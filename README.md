## Installation
An API development platform like ``Insomnia`` is required to run these paths as there is no front end in place.

## Usage
In your terminal do an ``npm install`` to download the necessary dependencies and then launch the server via ``nodemon`` or ``npm run start``. Enter data with the necessary key values and pretend like your fake users are friends.
